Sparked by the invasion of Poland by Germany under Adolf Hitler, the war saw immense battles across Europe, Africa, and Asia. It led to the Holocaust, the devastation of cities, and the use of nuclear weapons on Japan by the U.S. The conflict ended with the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers, fundamentally reshaping global politics and establishing the United Nations to promote peace."
